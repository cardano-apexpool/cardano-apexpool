      <h2>About the APEX Pool</h2>
      <p>
        This Pool is 24/7 online and it is operated by an IT Professional with more than 20 years of experience, with a lot of experience in IT Security and IT best practices, and involved in a few successful PCI DSS Audits in the last years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pool runs on three reliable, redundant virtual private servers, one block producer and two relays distributed on different hosts, in a data center in Europe, with multiple Internet connections. And at least one mode hidden relay, for more redundancy and protection against attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Pool will grow, some relays will be probably moved to public cloud virtual machines, distributed in different availability zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am running this pool because I believe in Cardano's future and I would like to be a part of it. I made a research about different blockchain projects, and I have chosen to put my faith in Cardano.
      </p>
      <p>
        I intend to run this pool with 0% Margin (Variable Fee) until it reaches enough ADA Active Stake to produce block each Epoch, and increase the Margin to 2% in case the Pool reaches there. I know the pledge is very low, I just started to buy ADA in February 2021, but I intend to use all pool rewards to increase the plegde, and I will also buy more ADA and use it for the same purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the pool will constantly produce blocks and earn rewards, there will be regular donations for <a href="https://www.daruiesteviata.ro/" target="_blank">"Asociaţia Dăruieşte Viaţă"</a>.
        Please support them if you can. Their IBAN accounts for donations are in the footer of their website.
